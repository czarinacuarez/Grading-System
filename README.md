# Customized Grading System
(Made last 2022, a beginner project)

This project is a customized grading system for our WEBPROG subject wherein it caters 2 sections - IT211 and IT212. The scoresheet here consists of customized criteria.
This is made from ArgonCSS, php, html, and uses mySQL as database.

The following features of the system are the following:
#### 1. Consists of 2 panels ( super admin and judges ).
#### 2. Super admin can add different judges accounts and groups per section.
#### 3. Super admin can see the following:
###### &ensp; 3.1 Ranking of all groups score.
###### &ensp; 3.2 Average scores.
###### &ensp; 3.3 Pie chart consisting of division of scores per judges ( per group ).
###### &ensp; 3.4 Each of the judges scores ( for transparency ).
 
#### 4. Judges can grade different groups.
#### 5. Completed with error handling.
